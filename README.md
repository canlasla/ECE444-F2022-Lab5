# What are the pros and cons of TDD?

## Pros
 - An advantage of TDD is that the code that will be developed will be modular. This is because it forces the developer to think about how to modularize the code as much as possible when when the tests are small.
 - Similar to the point above, because the code will be more modularized, the architecure of the system will generally have better quality. This is because the modularized code (forced by the creating tests first) will bring up any architectural issues in the first place.
 - Another advantage is that refactoring the code will be easier to do because the tests provide a clearer way to understand what the actual code will do. 
 - This approach usually yields high test coverage

## Cons
 - A disadvantage of TDD is that it tends to be a slow process. This is a bad software developement approach if the team wants to create something quick and rapidly.
 - Usually the whole team has to create the unit tests, which maybe hindering in progess because creating good quality tests is difficult
 - Difficult to apply this when using it on projects that use or interact with legacy systems.
